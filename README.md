Est.
====

Est. stands for estimate. It's a Unix shell program for estimating cardinality of input and heavy hiters of the stream.
You definitely will find it useful if you are working with large amount of text data and have a need to estimate how many unique lines in a file or output of some program.

When do you need it?
====================
`cat file | sort | uniq | wc -l` â€“ the simplest way to get the number of unique lines in a file. But there is one problem. Namely, `sort`. When you have tens of millions, and sometimes even millions of lines in a file, sorting become too expensive.
If you can trade precision for speed `est` utility is for you.

Installation
============
Java version 1.6 or higher is required for `est` utility.

Simply run fillowing command in your shell:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bazhenov/est/master/install.sh | sh

`est` programm will be i nstalled in `/usr/local/bin`.

Usage
=====
To estimate the number of unique elements:

    $ cat file | est uniq
    3443

 To estimate top k most frequent elements in the stream

    $ cat file | est top
      #      cnt.  pr.%  err.%  item

Performance
===========
On file containing 1 million of random numbers from 0 to 32756 `est` is about 30 times faster!
